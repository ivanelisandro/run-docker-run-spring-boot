title: Run Docker Run (Spring Boot)
language: English
summary: "<p>Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.\
  \ Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a container environment.\
  \ Container images are lightweight units that contain everything needed to run an\
  \ application. You can easily share your application with container images; everyone\
  \ you share it with gets the same container image that works similarly. Container\
  \ images become containers in the run time. In this project, you will learn how\
  \ to create and run a container with a web application.</p><br/><br/>Learn more\
